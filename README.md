📊 Financial Analyst Excel Formula Guide
This guide outlines the core Excel functions required for robust financial modeling, data analysis, and valuation. Mastering these formulas ensures model integrity, professional formatting, and efficient data retrieval.

🔍 1. Data Retrieval & Lookups
Used for pulling data from Trial Balances, General Ledgers, or across different model tabs.

XLOOKUP: The gold standard for modern lookups. It replaces VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP, offering better flexibility and error handling.

INDEX & MATCH: A powerful combination for looking up data in two dimensions (rows and columns) simultaneously.

OFFSET: Creates dynamic ranges; frequently used in Scenario Analysis to toggle between Base, Bull, and Bear cases.

🧠 2. Logical & Conditional Logic
Used for building "intelligent" models that respond to different business rules or accounting periods.

IF / IFS: Executes calculations based on specific conditions (e.g., checking if a debt covenant is breached).

SUMIFS: Aggregates totals based on multiple criteria (e.g., Total Revenue for Region A in Q2).

AND / OR: Enhances IF statements by checking for multiple requirements at once.

💰 3. Financial & Valuation
The core engine of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models and investment appraisals.

XNPV: Calculates the Net Present Value based on specific, irregular dates (far more accurate than standard NPV).

XIRR: Calculates the Internal Rate of Return for a series of cash flows on specific dates.

PMT: Determines periodic payments for loans or annuities.

EDATE / EOMONTH: Essential for building model timelines; ensures monthly or quarterly headers roll forward correctly.

🧹 4. Data Integrity & Formatting
Ensures models remain "client-ready" and free of visual errors.

IFERROR: Wraps complex formulas to hide #DIV/0! or #N/A errors, replacing them with a 0 or a blank.

TEXT: Formats numerical data as strings, useful for dynamic chart titles or report summaries.ections.
